newtons cradle with prezzies on ice or not?

idea: snowman balls where u have to push them to grow them to a certain size


 ## how to approach storing levels and the editor
 - maybe one folder for main levels and theyre 1. level name, 2. level name etc. and get parsed
 - import levels from union of levels, levels-custom and save to the latter
 - default size and click to paint tiles
 - probably wanna be able to shift like you can with text tho, that is nice. mmm

TODOS:
 - level menu
 - are we lerping out  positions or what
 - juice it up, sounds
 - graphics improvement - 3d voxels with translucent ice nice. puffy snow and wall walls. as for the character idk lol. shit billboard?
 - settings menu
 - wire up menu
 - maybe enforcing a certain level size / aspect ratio, or just center it for drawing and surround with WALL_TEXTURE?

 ## Level Concepts
 - got to have newtons cradling with one on snow in the middle of the ice!
 - non victory blocks (snowballs)
 - get snowballs to a certain size
 - lol cloning machine
 - maybe a hole would be good too, so u can have ice without necessarily having a wall u can go on. 1 way ice of a sort
 - crumbly block no going back

 - crate knocks a block
 - crate gets in the way e.g. makes a corner so u cant push something
 like 
 - to get to area have to move through a crate that fucks a block unless i do something first

 one way ice: walking on it from the side then theres a recess when u come back in

 what about a whole level made of crates where you cant move any of them except like one to win

 push a chain of crates to unstick a present


 use ice to unstick 2 blocks stuck together

there literally must be a level called boxed in like 
ccc
cpc
ccc

starts with
  ### 

#  b  #
# bpb #   or even better 1 b is a c and its not the one u move
#  b  #
          t#
  #########

puzzle games are the same as math homework whoa

 ## Bug
 - memory leaks from history records? no i dont think so, maybe they get big when you make a lot of moves with a lot of blocks. maybe it needs to check and just erase history if u exceed

 ## Aesthetic
Christmas is pretty fucking trash. What else is snow and icy?
 - i mean tongue in cheek christmas might be redeemable?
 - vikings
 - penguins
 - eskimos
 - yetis
 - you could be tibet santa
