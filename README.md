## Mechanics Ideas
 - Snowman balls where you push them and they grow
 - tnt boxes that take something out and make it ground
 - crumbly block no going back
 - multiple players (cloning machine?)
 - ice cube that slides no matter what its on
 - what if it was about building a snowman (getting the balls of snow to the right size where they go up by 1 every time you push on snow so you have to find a traversal of the correct distance, there would be bases and the rule is 3 high decreasing by 1)
  - have dirt, thin snow, deep snow
 - water is better flavour than hole lol and you can play a splash animation
 - tree you can walk through but not push blocks through

## Game Features
 - more cohesion would be nice. like maybe track the total number of presents so theres a number that goes up.
 - bonus levels where u just pump
 - extra hard collectibles like coloured santa hats would be cool
 - immersive overworld would be cool but maybe a ceebs, idk how undos would work if you had actual puzzles in there, and also camera panning. maybe divide into stages. could be cool to chunk levels that way
 - custom levels in main menu
 - in game menu (scene stack?)
 - reset, undo buttons that also hint 
 - settings
  - sound, music volume
  - write settings to disk
  - res
 - write save to disk
 - mobile
 - full screen

## Bugs
 - no movt sound
    - redo audio, i think just have it basically be a singleton / global, with an enum for the different sounds
    - see how jank it sounds just calling when player lands on block
    - maybe want something more sophisticated like while sliding play ice sound
 - record undo points from just running at a wall
 - music rewinds to zero

## Required juice
 - level number
 - scale level to the biggest that will fit
 - nice undos
   - vhs rewind effect
   - maybe a clean one with bars just moving and jumping around with t
   - could get some noise from sprite uvs
 - better sounds
 - nicer font
 - steam banner

 ## Level Concepts
 - got to have newtons cradling with one on snow in the middle of the ice!
  - doesnt really work cause u can just get in there as player?
 - intersecting ice rings


cool device

c/

corner you can go around once, maybe you have to push a block behind the crate going the other way

 - crate knocks a block
  - need crate somewhere but it knocks a present so u have to move that first
 - crate gets in the way e.g. makes a corner so u cant push something
 like 
 - to get to area have to move through a crate that fucks a block unless i do something first

 one way ice: walking on it from the side then theres a recess when u come back in

 what about a whole level made of crates where you cant move any of them except like one to win

 push a chain of crates to unstick a present


 use ice to unstick 2 blocks stuck together


or its ice, then open at the other end, and theres some use for it, but u had to use it to get first present in  location

fake receptacle, just a right angle with no space


hole puzzles:
you can push crates down to get rid of them
next to ice, you cant go that way on the ice but can still go across, AND no wall so you cant skate up to return to that row
so the hard part would be getting up to that part




 conveyor belts

 barricades for N presents


diode and double diode

leaking font thing is that bad?

--------------

can pimp the shit out of undo, make things slide back and control snow slidebackyness

---------

 oo a fractal / procedural walking sim would be cool
